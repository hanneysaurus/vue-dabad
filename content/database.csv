Beauty_and_the_Beast_2017;Movie;BluRay;Beauty and the Beast;2017;Bill Condon;YES;;NO;;;;;129;Fantasy, Drama, Romance;Emma Watson is a great bell. The voice-actors are great for Lumiere and Co. and it just looks magical. For me, this started the Disney Live Action era and it hasn't gotten as good as this. It's not like this is one of the best movies ever but it is a solid remake if you have to have one.;;;;;
Bee_Movie_2007;Movie;DVD;Bee Movie;2007;Simon J. Smith, Steve Hickner;YES;;NO;;;;;87;Animation, Coming-of-Age, Comedy;You like jazz? There is probably so many jokes I still need to discover here.

I love the little things that point out this movie was directed by a woman and has women at its center. We want more of this. Also Ewan McGregor makes a great villain and the soundtrack is amazing.

Black_Panther_2018;Movie;BluRay;Black Panther;2018;Ryan Coogler;YES;signed by Letitia Wright;YES;;;NO;Black Panther: Wakanda Forever;134;Action, SciFi, Drama;The costume and production design as well as the African accents are my favorite part of this movie. Chadwick Boseman will always be remembered as Black Panther and it is crazy how much talent they managed to put into this movie. It is one of the great Marvel movies and has set the way for so many more but it will always stay legendary no matter what else comes.;;;;;
BlacKkKlansman_2018;Movie;BluRay;BlacKkKlansman;2018;Spike Lee;YES;;NO;;;;;135;Drama, Biography, Comedy;It's funny and sad at the same time but it depicts one of the many mysteries of today's society really well: racism.;;;;;

Bombshell_2019;Movie;DVD;Bombshell;2019;Jay Roach;YES;;NO;;;;;105;Drama, Biography;No crying at Fox. The cast of this is insane and the fact that they added real-life footage that you cannot tell where it is also. Charlize Theron as Megyn Kelly should have earned her a second Oscar and Margot Robbie and Kate McKinnon are a super fun unexpected duo (as proven in Barbie). A standout: the Editing.;Charles Randolph;Theodore Shapiro;Barry Ackroyd;Colleen Atwood;Charlize Theron, Nicole Kidman, Margot Robbie, John Lithgow, Allison Janney, Malcolm McDowell, Kate McKinnon, Connie Britton, Liv Hewson, Mark Duplass, D'Arcy Carden, Jennifer Morrison, Madeline Zima

Call_Jane_2022;Movie;DVD;Call Jane;2022;Phyllis Nagy;NO;;NO;;;;;121;Drama;Elizabeth Banks makes all my guilty pleasure movies. This also stars Chris Messina and Sigourney Weaver so it has enough arguments to be in my library.;;;;;
Capote_2005;Movie;DVD;Capote;2005;Bennett Miller;NO;;NO;;;;;110;Biography, Crime, Drama;Truman Capote stars in Murder by Death. Philipp Seymor Hoffmann has an incredible filmography and of course is a huge part of the Hunger Games franchise so this movie is important.;;;;;

Carol_2015;Movie;BluRay;Carol;2015;Todd Haynes;YES;;NO;;;;;118;Romance, History, Drama;It's gay. It's also wonderful and sad and infuriating and Cate Blanchett and the music is hauntingly beautiful. You could actually categorize this as a Christmas movie too.;Phyllis Nagy;Carter Burwell;Edward Lachman;Sandy Powell;Cate Blanchett, Rooney Mara, Sarah Paulson, Kyle Chandler
Casino_Royale_2006;Movie;DVD;Casino Royale;2006;Martin Campbell;NO;;YES;;Quantum of Solace, Skyfall, Spectre;NO;No Time To Die;144;Action, Drama;If James Bond is considered movie history I will have the Daniel Craig ones to watch in my library because I will not have the others in my collection.

Charlies_Angels_2019;Movie;DVD;Charlie's Angels;2019;Elizabeth Banks;YES;;NO;;;;;114;Action, Comedy;Elizabeth Banks 🤷. For some reason this woman always hits my taste for casual movies exactly. Great talent, shallow story, fun little one-liners and cool soundtrack. Kristen Stewart and Naomi Scott did a great press tour and that's really all that it takes for me to like a movie and watch it more that others would.;Elizabeth Banks;Brian Tyler;Bill Pope;Kym Barret;Kristen Stewart, Naomi Scott, Ella Balinska, Elizabeth Banks, Patrick Stewart, Djimon Hounsou, Sam Claflin, Noah Centineo
Christopher_Robin_2018;Movie;DVD;Christopher Robin;2018;Marc Forster;YES;;NO;;;;;99;Adventure, Drama;I am only now realizing how many movies I have that star Ewan McGregor. Winnie the Pooh is important to me so this movie is obviously also part of my collection. I saw the Winnie the Pooh puppet they used in this movie so now it is even more meaningful to Honey. ;;;;;
Citizen_Kane_1941;Movie;DVD;Citizen Kane;1941;Orson Welles;NO;;NO;;;;;119;Drama, Mystery;Another classic I have never seen but is part of the collection because it is.;;;;;

As shallow as ""There is a leek in the boat"" is, it gets me every time and is incredibly cute.";;;;;
Clue_1985;Movie;DVD;Clue;1985;Jonathan Lynn;YES;;NO;;;;;93;Crime, Comedy;Classic 80s crime comedy that is a must-have for me. It is the little sister of Murder by Death and since that is the greatest movie I have ever seen in my life the family has to be complete.;;;;;

Crazy_Rich_Asians_2018;Movie;DVD;Crazy Rich Asians;2018;Jon M. Chu;YES;;NO;;;;;116;Comedy, Romance, Drama;Ching Fuuuu! The soundtrack is really great, but also it feels like something fresh in the Rom-Com universe. Awkwafina is always fun and seeing a collective culture represented on screen is always nice because it is relateable to me. I wonder what happened to the other movies they wanted to make. The one time I actually want sequels they don't make them.;;;;;
Dead_Poets_Society_1989;Movie;DVD;Dead Poets Society;1989;Peter Weir;NO;;NO;;;;;123;Coming-of-Age, Drama, Comedy;Classic that I haven't seen yet but it has Robin Williams and a famous scene where people stand on chairs.;;;;;
Death_on_the_Nile_1978;Movie;DVD;Death on the Nile;1978;John Guillermin;YES;;NO;;;;;134;Crime, Drama, Mystery;One of the best whodunnit movies ever made. The cast features the greatest actresses and actors of all time with Peter Ustinov and the best Poirot depiction. The music, the scenery and the plot make the two hours plus go by like nothing and the amount of people dying makes this one of the juicier cases  👀.;;;;;

Niemand wird und war jemals so cool wie die wilden Kerle. Camelot war ein Traum und das Gefecht zwischen den Wilden Kerlen und Michi und den Unbesiegbaren Siegern bei Camelot war damals das Epischste was die Filmwelt zu bieten hatte. Keine Diskussion.;;;;;
Divergent_2014;Movie;DVD;Divergent;2014;Neil Burger;YES;also available in Thai;YES;;Insurgent, Allegiant;YES;;134;SciFi, Drama, Action;We're lucky to live in the city. I don't like to admit this a lot, but this is probably the movie I have seen the most in my life. Why? Because it was in my DVD reader and I was playing Minecraft and didn't care to swap the film. Aside from that it really is a good movie. Music by Hans Zimmer and those Establishing shots with the voice over - honestly - it works. This film introduces the world of Divergent really well. It sets a great basis for a promising franchise. I'm sure the filmmakers picked up the great basework and continued the franchise with lots of respect to the book and dignity.;;;;;

I thought that without understanding the true power this woman holds. A great series that depicts the aweful truth and consequences of unfaithfulness.

The Wild Robot is genuinely one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen both visually and dramaturgically. I can see how it will mean different things to different people and I can definitely see how even I will see different things in the movie as life goes on. This movie is truly art and if it doesn't win the Oscar this year, it will be the second Robot-Animation film in a row to be snubbed for Best Animated Feature.;Chris Sanders, Peter Brown;Kris Bowers;Chris Stover;;Lupita Nyong'o, Pedro Pascal, Kit Connor, Bill Nighy, Stephanie Hsu, Ving Rhames, Mark Hamill, Catherine O'Hara, Matt Berry
